<blockquote>
<p>“reasoning from evidence” (p. 43)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“a <strong><em>process</em></strong> of drawing reasonable <strong><em>inferences</em></strong> about what students know on the basis of <strong><em>evidence</em></strong> derived from <strong><em>observations</em></strong> of what they say, do, or make in <strong><em>selected situations</em></strong>” (p. 112)</p>

<p>And a quote usually ascribed to Paul Dressel at various times and in various publications…let me know if you find a verifiable source.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> The Assessment Triangle<a href="twu-faculty-professional-learning.html#the-assessment-triangle" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="assets/otessa22/assessment-triangle.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Assessment triangle showing the three components of assessment (Pellegrino, et al. 2001).</p>
</div>
<p>The process of assessment begins with a detailed understanding and map of the cognitive construct that is to be learned. This might be the ability to correctly calculate doses of medication, or transpose a piece of music, or write an argumentative essay. Below is an example of nursing competence from Weeks et al. (2019).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="assets/twu-asmt/nursing.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Drug dosage calculation competence from Weeks et al. (2019)</p>
</div>
<p>Here are two documents in use in TWU Nursing. While these aren’t constructed specifically as cognitive models of the domain, but instead as evaluation tools, the represent comprehesive models of what is required to demonstrate competency.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cmadland/decks/blob/main/assets/twu-asmt/mosby.pdf">This is a checklist that nursing faculty use to allow learners to self-assess.</a><br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cmadland/decks/blob/main/assets/twu-asmt/n213.pdf">And another used in practicum evaluations.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The second component of the assessment triangle is an instrument of some kind designed to elicit the competencies mapped in the cognitive model. The instrument can vary widely from selected-response tests, videos, podcasts, performance tests in a lab, and many more.</p>
<p>The final component of assessment is an <em>inference</em> or <em>interpretation</em> of the data generated by the assessment instrument (not a <em>measurement</em>). The accuracy of the interpretation depends on how well the instrument aligns with the cognitive model (validity) and how stable the results are across populations (reliability).</p>
<div class="reflect">
<p>
One important thing to note is that many higher ed instructors
(outside of faculties of education or psychology) do not tend to have
much formal preparation in educational assessment, <em>however</em>,
higher education instructors <em>do</em> have extensive background and
preparation for conducting research. The assessment triangle above has
many parallels to research (cognitive model/literature review;
instrument to gather data; interpretation/discussion and
conclusions).

<!--
- Grade each bi-weekly assignment.  
- Read a subset of bi-weekly assignments, identify and share performance trends with the whole class.  
- Ask students to self-assess their bi-weekly assignments using evaluative criteria.  
- Use performance trends from the bi-weekly assignments to inform the redesign of the midterm or culminating assessment.  
- Develop a rubric or scoring guide to assess the culminating assignment in advance of student submissions.  
- Dedicate class time to discuss students’ performance trends from the midterm and address gaps in learning so students are better prepared for the culminating assignment.  
- Have every student complete the same culminating assignment using the same scoring rubric or guide.  
- Have all students complete the same culminating assignment with formal accommodations for students who require them.  
- Provide students with a choice of three different culminating assignments that assess the same learning goals.  
- Consistently apply late submission policies for all students when generating grades.  
- Consider each student’s individual circumstances when deciding how to apply late submission policies.  
- Use the late submission policy as a guideline to ensure a consistent principle is applied while also using professional judgement for students with individual circumstances.

- Give the student a 0 on the assignment.
- Have the student re-write the plagiarized section in their own words, then re-grade the assignment.
- Ask the students to reflect on why plagiarism is a problem and what they would do differently next time.
- As the instructor, reflect on how the assignment could have been structured differently to deter plagiarism.
- Adjust the student’s grade to reflect the portion of work that was plagiarized.
- Discuss with the student the reasons for the plagiarism, severity of plagiarism, and negotiate potential next steps for their learning.
- Apply the same consequence you would for other students to ensure all students are treated the same.
- Consider if the student has identified accommodations before determining response to plagiarism.
- Discuss why the student plagiarized and agree upon an appropriate alternative assignment.
- Apply all aspects of institutional policy on academic integrity to ensure consistency across all students.
- Consider the original aspects of the assignment and the plagiarized text to determine what the student knows and does not appear to know related to learning outcomes.
- Consider extenuating circumstances surrounding the plagiarism and use professional judgement when applying the institutional academic integrity policy.

<p class="caption">A Framework for Assessment as described below from DeLuca, et al. (2016)</p>
</div>
<p>DeLuca et al.’s model for assessment comprises four dimensions, each with three priority themes. Each of these dimensions influence the other dimensions, and all influence instructors’ approaches to assessment. The term ‘approaches to assessment’ is intended to convey the reality that assessment in formal education is tremendously complex and idiosyncratic. Assessment literacy is not a checklist of competencies, ‘best’ practices, or rules. The dimensions and their themes are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessment Purpose
<ul>
<li>…of learning<br />
</li>
<li>…for learning<br />
</li>
<li>…as learning<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assessment Processes
<ul>
<li>design<br />
</li>
<li>use and scoring<br />
</li>
<li>communication<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assessment Fairness
<ul>
<li>standard<br />
</li>
<li>equitable<br />
</li>
<li>balanced<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Measurement Theory
<ul>
<li>consistent<br />
</li>
<li>balanced<br />
</li>
<li>contextual</li>
</ul></li>
