I am grateful to be an uninvited guest on this land. To learn more, please visit the Westbank First Nation website. Figure 1. Author’s bicycle overlooking Okanagan Lake.

Approaches to Classroom Assessment from DeLuca et al. (2016) Approaches to Classroom Assessment Inventory designed to inventory K12 teachers’ thoughts, beliefs, actions related to assessment Assessment purpose (of, for, as learning) Assessment process (design, use/scoring, communication) Assessment fairness (standard, equitable, differentiated) Assessment theory (consistent, balanced, contextual) Technology-Mediated Assessment in Higher Education Contrasting with K12 There is a very large body of literature on assessment in K12 learning contexts, and a not-quite as large, but still substantial body of literature on assessment in higher education. It may be tempting to conflate the two contexts, but K12 teachers typically complete 2 full years of pedagogical training as part of their academic and practical preparation. These two years often include specific courses on assessment, learning theory, as well as domain-specific pedagogies. On the other hand, higher education instructors (from part-time sessionals to adjuncts to tenure-track and tenured faculty) tend to engage in little academic preparation in learning theories or assessment, although they seem to absorb the signature pedagogies of their discipline. Impact of Technology Impact on higher education is ubiquitous (SIS, LMS/VLE, CRM, etc.) Tends to emphasize efficiency (however ill-defined that may be) doing the same things with greater speed and/or reduced effort reinscribes mis-aligned assessment structures Pockets of Innovation Bearman et al. 2020 Bearman, M., Dawson, P., Ajjawi, R., Tai, J., &amp; Boud, D.
