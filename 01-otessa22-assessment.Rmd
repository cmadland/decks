>Bloom, B. (1968). Learning for Mastery. Instruction and Curriculum. Regional Education Laboratory for the Carolinas and Virginia, Topical Papers and Reprints, Number 1. *Evaluation Comment, 1*(2), 12.

- Incorporated `formative` and `summative` distinction into his ideas about `mastery learning`

- >test theory is machinery for reasoning from students' behavior to conjectures about their competence, as framed in a particular conception of competence."(p. 4).

> Black, P., & Wiliam, D. (1998). Assessment and Classroom Learning. *Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy & Practice, 5*(1), 7–74. https://doi.org/10/fpnss4

- major review of the literature on `formative assessment`  
- describe formative assessment as encouraging gains in achievement that were  

	  > among the largest ever reported for educational interventions (p. 61)

- "a process of drawing reasonable inferences about what students know on the basis of evidence derived from observations of what they say, do, or make in selected situations" (p. 112)  
- "reasoning from evidence" (p. 43)

###### Cognition {-}
- a cognitive model of the domain

###### Observation {-}

- a performance task used to gather data regarding learner achievement

###### Interpretation {-}

- an inference or judgement of the learner's achievement in relation to the model of the domain
